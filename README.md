# This is a React application that implements a simple phonebook. The application consists of several components:

    Container: a wrapper component that defines a basic layout for the application
    ContactForm: a form component that allows users to add new contacts to the phonebook
    Filter: a component that allows users to filter the phonebook by name
    ContactList: a component that displays the list of contacts in the phonebook and allows users to delete individual contacts

The main logic of the application is implemented in the App component, which maintains the state of the phonebook (i.e., the list of contacts and the current filter) and provides the necessary callbacks to handle user interactions. The App component also handles the persistence of the phonebook data using the browser's localStorage API.

When the component mounts, it retrieves any previously saved contacts from localStorage and initializes the state of the application. Whenever the state of the contacts changes (i.e., a new contact is added or an existing contact is deleted), the component updates localStorage with the latest version of the contacts.
